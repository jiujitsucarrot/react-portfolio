            Thank you for stopping by to take a glimpse into my coding journey. This has been one of the more challenging skills 
            I've decided to take on over the years, but I'm always excited for the challenge. My name is Tanner Norris! I am from 
            California but reside in Arizona. I am an educator as well as an active martial artist and coach. I am currently 
            enrolled in the Arizona State University Full Stack Bootcamp, learning both front end as well as back end web development.
            We have covered numerous different topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API's (Web, Third Party, Server Side), Node.js, 
            OOP (Object Oriented Programming), Express.js and MySQL just to name a few of what we have covered so far. There is still 
            so much more to learn, but that is half of the excitement! Whether attempting to master JavaScript being the current 
            language in front of me, or adding on new languages like Python or Ruby. Being a "forever student" I am eager to learn 
            all I can about the industry. I have attached some completed projects below, one being a group project and the others 
            being individual challenges. Please take a look, feel free to explore the content below! If you see any adjustments that 
            can be made or better habits to practice, please feel free to contact me utilizing the information listed below. Thank you 
            again for stopping by. Hope you enjoy the ride!
